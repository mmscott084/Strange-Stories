		<p>
		The concept of this site specifically deals with shapes, shades, colors and patterns.
		I am a space designer with a passion for color and patterns. My joy comes from the interaction of colors and shapes.
		I'd rather apply the aesthetics to content  to make it appeasing to the client and user.
		My value is providing life to content, relating colors and patterns to the information to provide a theme experience.
		My inspiration comes from my favorite movie "Ready Player One".
